                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                          description: |-
                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                          A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                          relates the key and values.

                                  Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required.
                                  If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified,
                                  otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits.

                  GeneratedSecrets stores references to secrets generated by the operator
                  from the server manifest's generatedSecrets section. The key is the
                  logical secret name from the manifest, and the value is a SecretKeySelector
                  referencing the concrete Secret and key that holds the generated value.

                                  fails, one of the conditions will have type "Failed" and status true. When
                                  a Job is suspended, one of the conditions will have type "Suspended" and
                                  status true; when the Job is resumed, the status of this condition will
                                  become false. When a Job is completed, one of the conditions will have
                                  type "Complete" and status true.

                                  A job is considered finished when it is in a terminal condition, either
                                  "Complete" or "Failed". A Job cannot have both the "Complete" and "Failed" conditions.
                                  Additionally, it cannot be in the "Complete" and "FailureTarget" conditions.
                                  The "Complete", "Failed" and "FailureTarget" conditions cannot be disabled.

                                  1. Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field.
