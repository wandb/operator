                                                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                                  This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                                  Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                                  have the following effect:
                                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                                  completed.

                                                  container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in

                                              An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                              user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                              To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                              Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                                      a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                                      This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                                      Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                                                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                                      This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                                      Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                                                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                            If set to true or not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful

                                            When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for

                                            Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                            init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                            to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                            unique among all containers.
                                            Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                            The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                            by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                            that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                            in a similar fashion.
                                            Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                                      container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                                      period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                                      or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                                  This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                                  Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                                  have the following effect:
                                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully

                                                  container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in

                                                  - Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.

                                            If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the SchedulingGated state and the
                                            scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod.

                                            SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation time, and be removed only afterwards.

                                                seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                                It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                                Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                                "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                                This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                                "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                                This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                                It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                                Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                                whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                                CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                                "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                                and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                                This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                                All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                                  and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.

                                                  of pods into each bucket.
                                                  We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                                  - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.

                                                    skew.
                                                  A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                                  if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                                  If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled

                                                  MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                                  won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                                  Use this if:
                                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                                     tracking are needed,
                                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                                  of an individual pod.

                                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                                  more information.

                                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                                  persistent volumes at the same time.

                                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                      to the PVC after it has been created.

                                                  image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                                  The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                                  - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                                  - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                                  - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                                  The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                                  A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                                  The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                                  The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                                  The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                                  Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                                  The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                                      Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                                      Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                                      IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                                      Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                      Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                                            chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                            Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a

                                                            request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                            certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                            certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume

                                                            Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                            by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                            timestamp.

                                                            Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                            field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and

                                                            The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                            entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                            entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                            signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                            Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code

                                                            your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                            with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                            certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                            will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                            consistent.

                                      pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                      be one of the following values:
                                      * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                      * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                        done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                        list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                        match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                        request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                        of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                        matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                      * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                        the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                        or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                      Implementations are required to support all path types.

                            `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have
                            been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is
                            homologous to each other.

                            `Indexed` means that the Pods of a
                            Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1),
                            available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index.
                            The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
                            for each index.
                            When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and
                            `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5.
                            In addition, The Pod name takes the form

                            the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`.

                            More completion modes can be added in the future.
                            If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which
                            is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller
                            skips updates for the Job.

                            When false or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job
                            and appends those labels to the pod template.  When true,
                            the user is responsible for picking unique labels and specifying
                            the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause this
                            and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see
                            `manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old `extensions/v1beta1`

                                      The list of indexes must be within 0 to ".spec.completions-1" and
                                      must not contain duplicates. At least one element is required.
                                      The indexes are represented as intervals separated by commas.

                                                      be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                      to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration

                                                      pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                                      Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                          This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                          Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                          have the following effect:
                                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                          completed.

                                          - At most 20 rules are allowed.
                                          - Rules can have the same action.
                                          - Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
                                          When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
                                          even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                      An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                      user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                      scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                      removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                      Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                    Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                    init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                    to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                    unique among all containers.
                                    Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                    The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                    by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                    that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                    in a similar fashion.
                                    Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                              PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                              API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                              preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use
                                                  a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                              The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                              Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                                          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                          This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                          Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                          have the following effect:
                                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                          completed.

                                                  not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use
                                                  a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                          sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                        seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                        It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                        Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                        "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                        This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                        "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                        This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                        It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                        Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                        whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                        CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                        "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                        If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                        and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                        This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                        All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                          to topologies that satisfy it.
                                          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                          and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                          Use this if:
                                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                             tracking are needed,
                                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                             information on the connection between this volume type
                                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                          of an individual pod.

                                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                          more information.

                                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                      provisioner.
                                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                        specified.
                                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                        in any namespaces.
                                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                          The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                          - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                          - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                          - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                          The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                          A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                          The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                          The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                          The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                          Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                          The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                              Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                              IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                              Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                    Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                    chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                    Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                    PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                    request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                    certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                    certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                    source in its spec.

                                                    Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                    by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                    timestamp.

                                                    Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                    field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                    certificateChainPath fields.

                                                    The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                    entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                    entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                    signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                    Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                    can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                    your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                    with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                    certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                    will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                    consistent.

                                                    The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                    issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                    use the certificates it issues.
                                                  properties:
                                                    certificateChainPath:
                                                      description: |-
                                                        Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.

                                                        Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                        and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                        and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                        files mid-rotation.

                                                    credentialBundlePath:
                                                      description: |-
                                                        Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                        The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                        The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                        key.

                                                        The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                        certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                        Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                        atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                        project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                        additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                        Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",
                                                        "ECDSAP521", and "ED25519".

                                                        maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                        certificate.

                                                        Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                        generates for this projection.

                                                        will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                        value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                        The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                        lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                        seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                        `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime

                          operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                      UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                      should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                      as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                      Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                      If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                      which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                      IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                      but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                      disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                      Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                      AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                      but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                      of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                      pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                      Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                      Additional policies may be added in the future.
                      Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                      if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                                                  A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that

                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                        (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
                                        In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.

                                If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
                                This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
                                when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

                            An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                            user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                            scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                            removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                            Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                            To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                            Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                                      (which defaults to None).

                                      RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                      recursively.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                          and unspecified `hostPort` fields in port definitions are defaulted to match `containerPort`.

                          When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for

                          Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                          init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                          to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                          unique among all containers.
                          Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                          The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                          by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                          that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                          in a similar fashion.

                                    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                    API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
                                is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                              seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                              It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                              Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                              "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                              This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                              "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                              This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                              It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                              Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                              whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                              CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                              "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                              and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                              This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                              All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.
                              Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                          Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                          chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                          Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                          PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                          request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                          certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                          certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                          source in its spec.

                                          Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                          by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                          timestamp.

                                          Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                          field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                          certificateChainPath fields.

                                          The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                          entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                          entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                          signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                          Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                          can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                          your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                          with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                          certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                          will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                          consistent.

                                          The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                          issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                          use the certificates it issues.

                                              Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                              and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                              and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                              files mid-rotation.

                                              Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                              The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                              The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                              key.

                                              The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                              certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                              Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                              atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                              project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                              additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                              maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                              certificate.

                                              Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                              generates for this projection.

                                              If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                              will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                              value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                              The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                              lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                              seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                              `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                              longer than 24 hours.

                                              userAnnotations allow pod authors to pass additional information to

                                              These values are copied verbatim into the `spec.unverifiedUserAnnotations` field of

                                              Signers should document the keys and values they support. Signers should

                                      set, the default cluster-wide tolerance is applied (by default 10%).

                                      For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,
                                      and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be
                                      triggered when the actual consumption falls below 95Mi or exceeds 101Mi.

                      case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid
                      values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address.  Setting
                      this to "None" makes a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is
                      useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is
                      not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and

                      be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,
                      clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same
                      value.

                      These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both
                      clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.

                      the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                      of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                      traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                      be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                      routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                      features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                      within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                      a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                      when picking a node.

                      type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                      options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                      to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                      specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                      EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                      allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                      than a virtual IP.
                      "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.
                      "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                      Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
